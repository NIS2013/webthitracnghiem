CHMOD /iplog/ to 777
Create and CHMOD /iplog/iplogfile.dat to 666
add the following line in any important .php file in the same directory as your anti_dos.php file so it can check IPs when that file is loaded, best example is index.php if you have it.
include("anti_dos.php"); //anti-DoS, prevents rapid accessing

 if you have a known cookie on your site, 
you can use this, otherwise just ignore this, it will set a different limit 
for people with this cookie
 
I use yourothercookie as the cookie ID for the forum, my forum uses ID 
greater than 0 for all members and -1 for guests and members who have logged out, 
so making it match greater than zero means members will get better access and 
guests with or without cookies won't

Also I use these cookies in the "flood alert" emails to make sure an important user didn't get banned. Someone could fake a cookie, so always be suspicious. Tez
